RLSTM: A New Framework of Stock Prediction by Using Random
Noise for Overfitting Prevention

Summary: The authors set out to develop a deep learning method that wouldn't overfit or generalize data. 
They name it RLSTM(Random Long Short-Term Memory). According to them their method performs better than other deep learning methods.



Stock closing price prediction based on sentiment analysis and LSTM

Summary:They have a LSTM-based model that takes into account investor sentiment and they use EMD, used 
to decompose the complex stock pricing sequence. lastly there is an attention mechanism which helps to focus on the most contributing information.



Improving stock trading decisions based onpattern recognition
using machine learning technology


Summary: used PRML, a novel pattern recongnition method, using maching learning methods. 
It uses the candlesticks three days prior in order to try to accurately predict the next days,
